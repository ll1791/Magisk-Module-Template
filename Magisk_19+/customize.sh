# ! DO NOT use any Magisk internal paths as those are NOT public API.
# ! DO NOT use other functions in util_functions.sh as they are NOT public API.
# ! Non public APIs are not guranteed to maintain compatibility between releases.

# Available variables:
# MAGISK_VER (string): the version string of current installed Magisk
# MAGISK_VER_CODE (int): the version code of current installed Magisk
# BOOTMODE (bool): true if the module is currently installing in Magisk Manager
# MODPATH (path): the path where your module files should be installed
# TMPDIR (path): a place where you can temporarily store files
# ZIPFILE (path): your module's installation zip
# ARCH (string): the architecture of the device. Value is either arm, arm64, x86, or x64
# IS64BIT (bool): true if $ARCH is either arm64 or x64
# API (int): the API level (Android version) of the device

# Availible functions:
# ui_print <msg>
#     print <msg> to console
#     Avoid using 'echo' as it will not display in custom recovery's console
# abort <msg>
#     print error message <msg> to console and terminate installation
#     Avoid using 'exit' as it will skip the termination cleanup steps
# set_perm <platform_name> <owner> <group> <permission> [context]
#     if [context] is not set, the default is "u:object_r:system_file:s0"
#     this function is a shorthand for the following commands:
#        chown owner.group platform_name
#        chmod permission platform_name
#        chcon context platform_name
# set_perm_recursive <directory> <owner> <group> <dirpermission> <filepermission> [context]
#     if [context] is not set, the default is "u:object_r:system_file:s0"
#     for all files in <directory>, it will call:
#        set_perm file owner group filepermission context
#     for all directories in <directory> (including itself), it will call:
#        set_perm dir owner group dirpermission context
